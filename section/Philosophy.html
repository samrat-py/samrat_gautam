                    I believe in learning one thing
                    at a time, building project by project, and trusting that steady effort leads to big
                    results.</span>

                    perfect. Every imperfect project is a stepping stone to better skills, clearer thinking,
                    and real-world experience.</span>

                <span class="poppins-regular">Curiosity is what keeps me going. Whether it’s trying out a
                    new framework or solving a tricky bug, I treat every challenge as a chance to learn
                    something new and expand what I can do.
